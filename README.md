Using Python library i have obtained financial data. I have extracted historical stock data using yfinance. 

Using the attribute info - i extracted the information on various stocks

Using the 'history()' method - i have extracted stock prices overtime (for the maximum period).

I have then plotted the change in the apple stock prices over the maximum period of time for this dataset.

Using the variable dividends i retrieved the dataframe of the data, then plot this dividens overtime.
